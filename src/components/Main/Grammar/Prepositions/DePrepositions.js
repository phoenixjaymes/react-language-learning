    <p>Prepositions show direction, location, or time, or introduce an object. They are usually followed by an objectâ€”a noun, noun phrase, or pronoun.</p>

    <p>Prepositions typically show how the noun, noun phrase, or pronoun is related to another word in the sentence. </p>

    <p>Prepositions in German grammar can indicate the case of the nouns, pronouns or articles that follow them. Some prepositions are always followed by the accusative case, others take the dative or genitive case. There are also two-way prepositions that can take either the accusative or dative case.</p>
